# Amino Acid Trainer

A simple Python program for learning amino acid abbreviations.

This program was created both as a way for me to practice biochemistry and to fulfill a university course project. It lets you practice the 1-letter and 3-letter abbreviations of amino acids, along with recognizing their structures.

While there are still a couple of minor visual bugs (which don’t affect functionality), I’m releasing it as-is since my project deadline is today. I may fix them in the near future.

## Credits

Special thanks to German Wikipedia user [**NEUROtiker**]([https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:NEUROtiker](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:NEUROtiker)), who created and released all the amino acid structure graphics into the public domain.  
Having consistent, high-quality images made this project much easier.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5

You can install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install PyQt5
